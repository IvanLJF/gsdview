        and save to several common imagery formats including GeoTIFF.
        
        Polarimetric decompositions can be applied to multi-pol SAR data. 
        Other software included in the package are an image viewer, 
        metadata viewer, a projection coordinate converter, and a variety of 
        command line tools.
    Convert to Vector
        Convert to Vector is a small program made to transform point or scene 
        information to various other formats that are compatible with external 
        applications such as Google Earth, GIS software such as ArcGIS, 
        text editors, and spreadsheets.
    SAR Training Processor
        The SAR Training Processor (STP) is a graphical tool written to assist
        in learning and teaching the flow of SAR processing.

BEAM_
    A toolbox for viewing, analyzing and processing of remote sensing data. 
    Originally developed to facilitate the utilization of image data from 
    Envisat's optical instruments, BEAM now supports a growing number of other
    sensors such as MODIS, AVNIR, PRISM and CHRIS/Proba.
PolSARPro_
    The Polarimetric SAR Data Processing and Educational Tool aims to facilitate
    the accessibility and exploitation of multi-polarized SAR datasets including
    those from ESA Third Party Missions (ALOS PALSAR), Envisat ASAR 
    Alternating Polarization mode products, RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X.
EnviView_
    EnviView is a free application, that allows Envisat data users to open any 
    Envisat data file, and examine its contents. 
    It provides simple visualisation capabilities, and allows data to be 
    exported to HDF for use in other software packages.
EOLI-SA_
    EOLi (Earth Observation Link) is the European Space Agency's client for 
    Earth Observation Catalogue and Ordering Services.
Radarworks_
    Matlab toolbox mainly intended for polarimetric SAR data processing.

InSAR tools
-----------

DORIS_
    Delft Object-oriented Radar Interferometric Software - InSAR / DInSAR 
    processor.
StaMPS_
    StaMPS stands for "Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers". 
    Although the original version was developed at Stanford University, 
    subsequent development has taken place at the University of Iceland and 
    Delft University of Technology.
    
    The package is no longer limited to persistent scatterers, 
    but also incorporates a small baseline and a combined time series method.
ROI_PAC_
    Repeat Orbit Interferometry PACkage by Caltech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
    mainly for interferometric SAR processing.
IDIOT_
    InSAR Deformation Inspection and Observation Tool (I.D.I.O.T.) is a software 
    package for fully automatic generation of differential SAR interferograms 
    from ENVISAT single look complex SAR data. 
    
    Its main purpose is to simplify as much as possible the generation of 
    differential SAR interferograms, even for complete novices in SAR 
    interferometry. 
    
    I.D.I.O.T. uses the freely available DEM of the SRTM mission to compensate 
    for topography and can work with both the coarse header orbits or precise 
    orbit information. All interferometric processing steps are implemented 
    having maximum interferogram quality and precision in mind.
