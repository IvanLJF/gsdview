:28/11/2010: GSDView Open v. 0.6.4 run on Fedora_ 14.

             In Fedora_ 14 it has been fixed a bug in GDAL packaging
             that caused a GSDView crash on startup.
             The (recently updated) RPM package now runs nicely on
             Fedora_ too.

:14/11/2010: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.4 released.

             This is an hot-fix release that restores the complete
             compatibility with GDAL 1.6.x series.

             Also some new feature have been added: see :doc:`CHANGES`.

:13/11/2010: Ubuntu packages now available via Launchpad.

             Source packages and pre-build binary packages for Ubuntu 10.10
             are now available via PPA (Personal Package Archive) on Launchpad_.

:13/08/2010: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.3 released.

             This release has been implemented a complete switch of the
             application to the new PyQt4_ API (new signal/slot handling,
             QString and QVariant are gone, etc.).
             For this reason GSDView now requires PyQt4_ v. 4.6 or newer.

             Also some new feature have been added: see :doc:`CHANGES`.
