             handling of computation tasks (including statistics and histogram 
             computation).

             GDAL 1.6.x series introduced a lot of new interesting features
             and a better progress handling.
             Dropping 1.5.x series allow to use this new features in the 
             `development branch`_ to make GSDView even better.

             The package provides a standalone executable of GSDView 0.6.1 
             with a couple of micro-patches backported from trunk.
             
             While GSDView 0.6.1 is considered quite stable the package for
             `Mac OS X`_ is brand new and it is considered beta quality, 
             so any kind of feedback is welcome.
