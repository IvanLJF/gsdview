:31/07/2011: GSDView now also works with PySide_

             Full support to PySide_ has been implemented.
             Now GSDView can optionally use PySide_ as Qt4_ bindings instead
             PyQt4_ and SIP_.

:24/07/2011: A new tentative package for Mac OS X

             A new tentative package for Mac OS X. It includes a beta
             version of GDSView 0.6.5.

             Feedback is very welcome.

:28/11/2010: GSDView Open v. 0.6.4 run on Fedora_ 14.

             In Fedora_ 14 it has been fixed a bug in GDAL packaging
             that caused a GSDView crash on startup.
             The (recently updated) RPM package now runs nicely on
             Fedora_ too.
