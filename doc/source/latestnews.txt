:24/07/2011: A new tentative package for Mac OS X

             A new tentative package for Mac OS X. It includes a beta
             version of GDSView 0.6.5.

             Feedback is very welcome.

:28/11/2010: GSDView Open v. 0.6.4 run on Fedora_ 14.

             In Fedora_ 14 it has been fixed a bug in GDAL packaging
             that caused a GSDView crash on startup.
             The (recently updated) RPM package now runs nicely on
             Fedora_ too.

:14/11/2010: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.4 released.

             This is an hot-fix release that restores the complete
             compatibility with GDAL 1.6.x series.

             Also some new feature have been added: see :doc:`CHANGES`.
