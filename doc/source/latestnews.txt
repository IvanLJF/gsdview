:09/05/2010: Binary package for `Mac OS X`_ released

             The long waited binary package for `Mac OS X`_ is now available.
             The package provides a standalone executable of GSDView 0.6.1 
             with a couple of micro-patches backported from trunk.
             
             While GSDView 0.6.1 is considered quite stable the package for
             `Mac OS X`_ is brand new and it is considered beta quality, 
             so any kind of feedback is welcome.

:09/05/2010: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.1 released.

             This new release brings some major improvement to GSDView
             including basic support for RGB views, a new tool for image
             stretching and a new component for mouse modes handling.

             Also there is a new dialog that shows detailed info about
             application crashes and allow the user to submit bug reports.
