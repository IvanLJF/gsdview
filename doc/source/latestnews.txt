:04/11/2012: Implemented support for `Python 3`_.

             Now GSDView can be run using `Python 3`_ (GDAL_ >= 2.0 is
             required).
             Contextually support for Python < 2.6 has been dropped.

:03/09/2012: SCM moved to Git_

             The GSDView code is now maintained in a Git_ repository.

             Git_ is a modern and distributed SCM system that makes it easier
             for developers to manage the development process.

             All developers that have a checkout of the old SVN repository
             should make a fresh checkout.

:03/09/2012: The GSDView project moves to Allura_

             The GSDView project on sourceforge.net has been converted to use
             the new Allura_ platform.

:13/11/2011: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.5 released.

             Fixed some compatibility issues with new PyQt4_ and SIP_
             versions.  Full support to PySide_ (>= 1.0.4).

             Please refer to :doc:`CHANGES` for more details.
