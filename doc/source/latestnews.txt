             new PyInstaller_ 2.0.

:04/11/2012: Implemented support for `Python 3`_.

             Now GSDView can be run using `Python 3`_ (GDAL_ >= 1.10 is
             required).
             Contextually support for Python < 2.6 has been dropped.

:03/09/2012: SCM moved to Git_.

             The GSDView code is now maintained in a Git_ repository.

             Git_ is a modern and distributed SCM system that makes it easier
             for developers to manage the development process.

             All developers that have a checkout of the old SVN repository
             should make a fresh checkout.
