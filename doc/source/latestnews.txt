:13/08/2010: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.3 released.

             This release has been implemented a complete switch of the
             application to the new PyQt4_ API (new signal/slot handling,
             QString and QVariant are gone, etc.).
             For this reason GSDView now requires PyQt4_ v. 4.6 or newer.

:20/07/2010: GSDView Open Source Edition v. 0.6.2 released.

             This release don't include big changes visible to the user.
             It introduces some important internal changes such as the switch
             to GDAL 1.6.x series and a new system for full asynchronous
             handling of computation tasks (including statistics and histogram
             computation).

:01/07/2010: GDAL 1.5.x series dropped.

             GDAL 1.6.x series introduced a lot of new interesting features
             and a better progress handling.
             Dropping 1.5.x series allow to use this new features in the
             `development branch`_ to make GSDView even better.
